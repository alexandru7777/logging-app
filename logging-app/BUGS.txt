### AUTH ERROR

-- remove auth-context and replace it with something else
-- redo the access from the frontend and also check the backend to have the route for GET request

Authentication logic - check other projects and methods;

-- test and if succeeded --> proceed on UI ;

After proceeding on UI, start the development on VM side;

When both applications are alligned and function correctly start polishing and documenting to prepare for deployment (use localhost for deployment);

===============================SOLVED===================================
-- Auth error - changed frontend configuration, performs correctly now;

UI/UX:
    1. Pagination - restrict the amount of tickets shown;
    2. Size: reduce the size of the cards;
    3. Create a nice tabel around them for the pagination;
    4. Create Filters (by logs / by warn/erro, by message)
    5. Add fonts in tailwind config;
    6. Create individual page - when clicking on a card --> go to a page where every detail is taken for that card (not required, but it would be nice!).


-- Pagination added (missing content number);
-- Redo the cards --> tabel (better look - more organized)
-- Added 3 filters (work on UI more to add a better filtering space);

-- Moved the bash script --> python script (run python --> run curl)
 ++ To do:
    + Add delete button for logs to erase from database;
    + Add better UI for filtering + number pages;
    + Add export to excel option (create a microservice)
    + 


## 21.12.2023

Error now appears to be manifasting because of the dockerfiles especially the frontend so something must be revised into docker-compose;
So we have the error and the dockerfiles that need to be adjust in rest all services are working and ansible is successfully reaching the server;

SOLUTION: fix the files and retry deployment;

$ yum remove docker \
  docker-client \
  docker-client-latest \
  docker-common \
  docker-latest \
  docker-latest-logrotate \
  docker-logrotate \
  docker-engine
$ yum install -y yum-utils
$ yum-config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
$ yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
$ systemctl start docker
$ systemctl enable docker

-- reinstall docker properly for centos...
